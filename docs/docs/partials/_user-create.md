If you have friends or family members who want to use the application as well, you can create additional accounts for them.

<img src={require('./img/create-new-user.png').default} width="90%" title='New User Registration' />

In the Administration panel, you can click on the **Create user** button, and you'll be presented with the following dialog:

<img src={require('./img/create-new-user-dialog.png').default} width="90%" title='New User Registration Dialog' />

You can then set an initial password. If you'd like, you can use an easy password like `password`, and keep the setting **Require user to change password on first login** active. This will prompt the user to change their password on first login, to a password that they choose.
